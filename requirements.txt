# Utilities
tqdm # Progress bars

# --- Hugging Face Hub ---
# huggingface-hub >= 0.20.0 # For model downloads & potentially CSM interaction
huggingface-hub==0.28.1 # From CSM

# --- STT ---
faster-whisper # Requires CTranslate2 backend, often bundled or installed separately if needed
# If build issues: pip install ctranslate2 -U # May need specific version

# --- LLM Engine ---
# vllm # Preferred engine for optimized inference # Already uncommented above
# sentencepiece # Often a dependency for tokenizers, install if needed by LLM/vLLM # Already included above

# --- RAG (Langchain + FAISS GPU) ---
langchain >= 0.1.0
langchain-community # Common loaders, stores etc.
langchain-huggingface # For HF embeddings if used
# Vector Store - FAISS for GPU acceleration
# faiss-gpu # Recommended for CUDA systems
faiss-gpu # Recommended for CUDA systems
# OR use faiss-cpu if GPU issues/preference
# faiss-cpu
# OR use ChromaDB
# chromadb
# Document Loaders (add more as needed)
pypdf # For PDFs
# python-docx # For .docx
# unstructured # For complex/varied document types
# Embeddings (using HF sentence-transformers)
sentence-transformers

# --- GUI (Example: CustomTkinter) ---
# customtkinter # Uncomment if using CustomTkinter for GUI
# Pillow # Often needed for images in GUI

# --- Sesame CSM Dependencies ---
# NOTE: Key dependencies like torch, transformers, etc., should align with
# requirements specified in external/csm/requirements.txt.
# Manually check external/csm/requirements.txt and add any MISSING dependencies here,
# or ensure versions above are compatible.
# Examples of potential CSM requirements (VERIFY IN external/csm/requirements.txt):
# transformers>=4.38 # Check CSM's required version # Added above with specific version
# accelerate # Included above
# bitsandbytes # If CSM uses quantization # Included above
# einops
# xformers # If used by CSM or its dependencies
# Note: CSM dependencies added near the top (moshi, torchtune, etc.)
